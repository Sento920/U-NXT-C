# U-NXT-C
A Standalone Game in C. SDL library used.

To Compile SDL correctly, include the #include <SDL2/whatever.h>

Then use the command g++ filename.cpp -w -lSDL2 -o outputname

Temporary Possible Program Structure:
    /Project
    >Main.cpp
    >Main.h
    >Window.cpp
    >Window.h
    >/Graphics
    >/Sounds
    
    
This structure is VERY premature, and will most likely be changed as needed.
However, it is in place to give a general idea of the structure.
